          My career in technology started when I entered Digital Crafts' bootcamp by way of City of Refuge. 
          Making lifelong friendships, and solidifying a foundation of learning that has carried me through my start in technology. 
          I have variety of passions and interests. 
          One of which would be to learn to cook better.
          I like to keep up with national and geo-political goings-on.
